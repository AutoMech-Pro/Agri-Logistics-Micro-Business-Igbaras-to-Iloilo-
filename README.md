# Agri-Logistics-Micro-Business-Igbaras-to-Iloilo-

Igbaras, located in the southwestern part of Iloilo, remains a vital vegetable basket for the province. As of late 2025, logistics constraints continue to hinder small-scale farmers from maximizing profit margins at the major trading centers.

This updated business model proposes a specialized Agri-Logistics Service. By utilizing an insulated van, the business minimizes post-harvest losses (currently estimated at 18-22% in traditional jeepney transport) and connects the highlands directly to the Iloilo Terminal Market ("Super") and institutional buyers.
